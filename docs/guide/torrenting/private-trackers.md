# Private Trackers Explained

### Key Differences from Public Trackers

- Invite-only membership systems
- Ratio enforcement (typically 1:1 minimum)
- Bonus point systems for long-term seeding
- Community-driven content curation
- Strict rules against cross-tracking

### Getting Started

1. **Acquire invites** through:
   - Official recruitment threads (Reddit/forums)
   - Interview systems (e.g., REDActed)
   - User-class promotions
2. **Seedbox Recommended**: Maintain ratios with 24/7 seeding
3. **Client Whitelist**: Only approved clients allowed

### Ratio Management

- **Freeleech** (FL) torrent strategies
- **Per-Torrent vs Global** ratio systems
- Bonus point conversion rates
- Hit-and-run penalties
