# What is Vocaloid?

Vocaloid is a computer program that lets you make realistic singing voices without a human singer. Think of it like a digital singer on your computer

## How Vocaloid Works

1. You type in the words you want to be sung
2. You choose the notes and how long each note should be
3. You can add special effects like vibrato (voice wobble)
4. The computer creates a singing voice that sounds like it's coming from a real person
